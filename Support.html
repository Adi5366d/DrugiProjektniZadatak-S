                Third party software consists of unapproved apps that manipulate gameplay. By altering game functionality, third party software aims to provide unfair advantages, while putting your account and privacy at risk.
                
                Third party software includes:
                
                Hacks, "mods," or programs that unfairly alter game functionality
                "Bots," or gameplay automation services or scripts
                Any other programs that aim to modify or provide unearned progress.</p>
