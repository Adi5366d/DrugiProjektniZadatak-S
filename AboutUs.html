                Supercell focuses on the development of free-to-play games that yield profits through the in-game micropayments.
                The company's objective is to focus on the successful games that stay popular for years. The focus has not been on revenue,
                but on the principle "just design something great, something that users love."Game development focuses around "cells" of five to seven people 
                which start with idea generation and an initial review by CEO Paananen. The team subsequently develops the idea into a game, which the rest of
                the company's employees get to play-test, followed by play-testing in Canada's App store; if the Canada reception is good, the next step is global
                rollout (App Store).Successful failures are celebrated by employees. One of the games that was cancelled well into development was Battle
                Buddies, which had also been rated well in the test market, but the number of players was still too small. The final decision for cancelling 
                a project is done by the development team themselves.

                It’s a poorly kept secret that Supercell’s first office was a snug 35m2 room that had to fit 15 people, their laptops and a coffee-maker. Eventually the CEO moved his desk (a cardboard box at the time) out into the hallway to free up some space. In 2021, after outgrowing a number of locations around Helsinki,
                 we opened our own, custom-designed office on the seafront, just south of the city center.
